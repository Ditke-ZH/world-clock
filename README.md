I embarked on a 2-week SheCodes Plus Add-On Workshop dedicated to crafting an ingenious world-clock app. 
This project was shaped using the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
My focus was on unraveling the complexities of diverse time zones and seamlessly integrating them into an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Technologies employed:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- API integration
